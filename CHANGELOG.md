# Changelog

## Unreleased

- The middle pane lists your articles, newest first. `j`/`k` move, `gg`/`G` jump to the top or bottom, and `o` or `Enter` (or a click) opens one in the right pane and marks it read. Unread titles are bold. New articles from a refresh appear on their own.
- Feeds refresh in the background while the app is open: at launch, then every 30 minutes (`[refresh] minutes` in `config.toml`; 0 turns it off). `gutenberg --refresh` refreshes now and prints what changed. Unchanged feeds cost a single request, and a feed that's down is retried later instead of showing an error.
- `gutenberg --add` takes a site address too: it finds the feed the site links to, or tries `/feed`, `/rss` and `/atom.xml`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-20

- Running `gutenberg` opens the main window with its three panes. Press `q` to quit.
- Pane widths can be set in `~/.config/gutenberg/config.toml` under `[layout]` (`sources`, `list`, `article`; 0 hides a pane). Edits apply while the app is open.
- Add a feed from the terminal with `gutenberg --add <feed-url>`. RSS, Atom and JSON Feed all work; a bad feed or address prints one line saying what went wrong.
- Install with one line: `curl -fsSL https://avdrav1.github.io/gutenberg/install.sh | sh`. The script checks the download against the release checksums and installs to `~/.local/bin`.
